# ChessCS
A chess engine written in C#(backend) and angular 4 (frontend). The engine is built using optimized minimax algorithm that can search 4 to 8 moves ahead. The engine can easily beat a decent chess player. 
##### A demo worths a thousand words (http://113.160.166.87:8096)
##### Technology stack
- Frontend: Angular 4, Typescript
- Backend: ASP.NET MVC 5, ASP Identity for authentication
- Algorithm: alpha-beta pruning & optimization
##### Skill and knowledge achievements:
- Data structure and algorithms (alpha-beta pruning, hash table, etc)
- Optimization (move orderings, killer moves)
- C# Windows Application
- Source control (GIT)
